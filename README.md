# Machine Learning with PyTorch

## Introduction 

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebook tutorials on machine learning with Python 3.   

Notes are written in a rigorous fashion. As a mathematician, ambiguity is intolerable. 




All content is created by myself. However, pobody's nerfect. Feel free to point out any mistakes or suggest any improvements ;)

## Contents

- Linear Algebra and Matrix Calculus Review
- Probability and Statistics Review

- Regression
- Classification

## Dependencies

Python 3.8.5

Anaconda 4.9.2 

## Jupyter Notebook Settings 

Please use a dark theme in order to view images in the notebooks as the images are created using colors most suitable for a dark background.  

The basic Jupyter Notebook is neither efficient nor easy on the eyes. Below are what I do to improve both. 

### Jupyter Themes 
My favorite Jupyter Notebook theme is from [jupyterthemes by dunovank](https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes):

Step 1: install jupyterthemes 

``pip install jupyterthemes``

Step 2: select the theme and various fonts for codes, texts, and notebooks. 

``jt -t monokai -f ubuntu -nf ptsans -tf exosans -T -N``

### Jupyter Notebook Extensions 

Since the notebooks are relatively long, I strongly recommend installing [jupyter_contrib_nbextensions](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) 
and enabling the following nbextensions:

- Table of Contents (2)
- Collapsible Headings
- Equation Auto Numbering 
- Codefolding 
- LaTeX environment for Jupyter 
- Load TeX macros (see ``latexdefs.tex`` for details)
-
